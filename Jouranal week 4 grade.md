This is the fourth week for me to meet with the teacher and the class groups I am so excited, and glad be here.

I think I still deserve to get a grades "B" in this class and get the grade  "A" for ( week 4 jouranal) because I pay more 
attention to the teacher and participate in the class, I believe I gain more knowledge about Linux thats make more comfortable to 
work with Linux.
