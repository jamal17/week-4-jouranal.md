This is the fourth week for me to meet with the teacher and the class groups I am si excited, and glad to be  for me to be here.
I think I still deserve to get a grades "B" in this this clas and get the grade of "A" for ( week 4 jouranal) because I pay more 
attention to the teacher and participate in the class, Ibelieve I gain more knowledge about Linux thats make more comfortable to 
work with Linux. .
